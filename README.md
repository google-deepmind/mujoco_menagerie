**Menagerie** is a collection of high-quality models for the [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org/) physics engine, curated by Google DeepMind.

A physics simulator is only as good as the model it is simulating, and in a powerful simulator like MuJoCo with many modeling options, it is easy to create "bad" models which do not behave as expected. The goal of this collection is to provide the community with a curated library of well-designed models that work well right out of the gate.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The minimum required MuJoCo version for each model is specified in its respective README. You can download prebuilt binaries from the GitHub [releases page](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco/releases/), or if you are working with Python, you can install the native bindings from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mujoco/) via `pip install mujoco`. For alternative installation instructions, see [here](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco#installation).

### Overview

The structure of Menagerie is illustrated below. For brevity, we have only included one model directory since all others follow the exact same pattern.

```bash
├── agility_cassie
│   ├── assets
│   │   ├── achilles-rod.obj
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── cassie.png
│   ├── cassie.xml
│   ├── LICENSE
│   ├── README.md
│   └── scene.xml
```

- `assets`: stores the 3D meshes (.stl or .obj) of the model used for visual and collision purposes
- `LICENSE`: describes the copyright and licensing terms of the model
- `README.md`: contains detailed steps describing how the model's MJCF XML file was generated
- `<model>.xml`: contains the MJCF definition of the model
- `scene.xml`: includes `<model>.xml` with a plane, a light source and potentially other objects
- `<model>.png`: a PNG image of `scene.xml`

Note that `<model>.xml` solely describes the model, i.e., no other entity is defined in the kinematic tree. We leave additional body definitions for the `scene.xml` file, as can be seen in the Shadow Hand [`scene.xml`](shadow_hand/scene_right.xml).

### Installation and Usage

To install Menagerie, simply clone the repository in the directory of your choice:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco_menagerie.git
```

The easiest way to interactively explore a model is to load it in the [simulate](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco/tree/main/simulate) binary which ships with every MuJoCo distribution. This amounts to simply dragging then dropping the `scene.xml` file into the simulate window. If you prefer, you can also use the command line to launch `simulate` and directly pass in the path to the XML.

Outside of interactive simulation, you can load a model exactly as you would with any other XML file in MuJoCo, either via the C/C++ API:

```c++
#include <mujoco.h>

mjModel* model = mj_loadXML("unitree_a1/a1.xml", nullptr, nullptr, 0);
mjData* data = mj_makeData(model);
mj_step(model, data);
```

or via Python:

```python
import mujoco

model = mujoco.MjModel.from_xml_path("unitree_a1/a1.xml")
data = mujoco.MjData(model)
mujoco.mj_step(model, data)
```

If you have further questions, please check out our [FAQ](FAQ.md).

## Model Quality and Contributing

Our goal is to eventually make all Menagerie models as faithful as possible to
the real system they are being modeled after. Improving model quality is an
ongoing effort, and the current state of many models is not necessarily
as good as it could be.

However, by releasing Menagerie in its current state, we hope to consolidate
and increase visibility for community contributions. To help Menagerie users
set proper expectations around the quality of each model, we introduce the
following grading system:

| Grade | Description                                                 |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| A+    | Values are the product of proper system identification      |
| A     | Values are realistic, but have not been properly identified |
| B     | Stable, but some values are unrealistic                     |
| C     | Conditionally stable, can be significantly improved         |

For more information regarding contributions, for example to add a new model to
Menagerie, see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).
