## Overview

This package contains a simplified robot description (MJCF) of the [xArm7
arm](https://www.ufactory.cc/product-page/ufactory-xarm-7/) developed by
[UFACTORY](https://www.ufactory.cc/). It is derived from the [publicly available
URDF
description](https://github.com/xArm-Developer/xarm_ros/tree/master/xarm_description/urdf/xarm7).

## URDF â†’ MJCF derivation steps

1. Added `<mujoco> <compiler discardvisual="false" fusestatic="false"/> </mujoco>` to the URDF's
   `<robot>` clause in order to preserve visual geometries.
2. Loaded the URDF into MuJoCo and saved a corresponding MJCF.
3. Manually edited the MJCF to extract common properties into the `<default>` section.
4. Added actuators for the arm and hand.
5. Added `scene.xml` which includes the robot, with a textured groundplane, skybox, and haze.
