## URDF â†’ MJCF derivation steps

1. Used the hands .xmls through by [ARISE](https://github.com/ARISE-Initiative/robosuite) (to the best of my knowledge). 
2. Broke most of the .stls into multiple smaller versions using blender to match the inspire hand colors.
3. Manually edited the MJCF to extract common properties into the `<default>` section.
4. Added position-controlled actuators.
5. Added `impratio=10` for better noslip.
6. Added `scene_left.xml` and `scene_right.xml` which include the robot, with
    an object, textured groundplane, skybox, and haze.
